#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Run_analysis.R 

run_analysis.R does the following:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Codebook
The codebook explains all the variables in the UCI HAR Dataset. All of the vairables are organized in run_analysis.R. 

## Tidy Data Set
The tidy data set is the resulting data frame that is created in run_analysis.R.

## Steps to add files to remote Repository
1. Create a Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project repository on github
2. Clone the repository onto local computer, so you can access the files in the repository
3. On Git Bash, go into local forked repository.
4. Place files in local repository
5.Push files to remote Repository
